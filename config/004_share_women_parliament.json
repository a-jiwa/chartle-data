  "infoDescription": "Between 1994 and 2024, Rwanda increased the proportion of women in its national Parliament from 4.3% to 63.8%, representing one of the most significant gains in gender representation globally.\nIn 2008, Rwanda became the first country in the world to achieve a female majority in its lower house, with women holding 56% of the seats. This majority has been consistently maintained since then.\nAs of 2024, only six countries have reached or surpassed gender parity (50%) in their lower or single parliamentary chambers. Cuba and Nicaragua exceed the 50% threshold, while Mexico, Namibia, and the United Arab Emirates have achieved exact parity.\nThese figures contrast sharply with the global average, which remains at just 26.4% female representation in lower house parliaments."
